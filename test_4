Findings most likely relate to pulmonary\nedema. Underlying infection or neoplasm, as noted on the prior\nCT within the left lung cannot be discerned on this exam.\n.\nTTE ([**2180-10-30**]):\nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global\nsystolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is no aortic\nvalve stenosis. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.\nThe effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right\natrial diastolic collapse. There is brief right ventricular\ndiastolic compression/collapse, consistent with impaired\nfillling/tamponade physiology. Moderate pericardial effusion\nwith echo evidence of tamponade.\n.\nCT Chest With Contrast ([**2180-10-30**]):\nNo evidence of pulmonary embolism. Massive progression of\ndisease with substantial generalized severe mediastinal and\nhilar lymphadenopathy, newly appeared bilateral pleural\neffusions, newly appeared pericardial effusion, newly appeared\nmultifocal pneumonia, and evidence of lymphangitis\ncarcinomatosa.\n.\nTTE ([**2180-10-31**]):\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).\nThere is a very small pericardial effusion which is partially\nechodense. The pericardium may be thickened but is not well\nvisualized. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of\n[**2180-10-30**], the pericardial effusion is now much smaller.\n.\nCXR [**2180-11-2**]:\nIMPRESSION: Further progression of metastatic breast cancer\ndisease with\npericardial effusion, extensive infiltrates in left lower lobe,\nand additional\nprobably metastatic spread in other lung regions. It cannot be\ndecided\nwhether the described findings have any relevance to\ntherapeutically-induced\nfluid overload.\n.\nECHO [**2180-11-3**]: Conclusions\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\nThere is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears\ncircumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with\nblood, inflammation or other cellular elements.\nIMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion.\nBilateral pleural effusions.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n52 year old woman with a PMH significant for metastatic breast\ncancer with lung and brain metastases admitted originally to the\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of respiratory distress, then transferred to\nCCU after pericardiocentesis for cardiac tampoande, then\ntransferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 2035**] after pt's respiratory status stabilized.\n.\n#. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: On presentation to the ICU, the\npatient denied any fevers but reported a productive cough of\nseveral months duration. CXR on arrival demonstrated left\nperi-hilar and basilar infiltrates with concern for infectious\nconsolidation/pneumonia, pleural effusion or progression of\nmetastatic disease as her cancer was known to be located in the\nleft lower lobe. A CT with contrast was performed to further\nevaluate the intrapulmonary process and demonstrated a\nmultifocal pneumonia, progression of the pulmonary metastases,\npleural effusions as well as a moderate-to-large pericardial\neffusion (see below for management of pericardial effusion) but\nwas negative for a pulmonary embolism. Given productive cough\nand radiographic evidence the patient was started on Levaquin\nand Vancomycin for robust CAP treatment. On review of her\nmedical chart, HCAP was considered more likely and she was\nstarted on Levoquin and Cefipime. Blood and urine cultures were\nperformed and showed no growth as well as an Influenza DFA,\nwhich was negative. The patient was maintained on oxygen by\nnasal canula to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 90%.\nUrine culture showed no growth though UA was positive for\nleukocytes, as she was already on broad spectrim antibiotics, no\nadditional coverage was added. Antibiotics were changed to\nLevaquin and flagyl to cover postobstructive pneumonia, she will\nfinish a course of 8 days on [**2180-11-8**]. On [**10-31**], patient spiked\nfever to 100.9 and cefipime was restarted. After arrival to\n[**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so\nCepfepime was dc'd again.  Pulmonary was consulted and per their\nrecs, Vanc was restarted and Flagyl was dc'd after 5 days.  Pt\nultimately completed 8d of Levoquin and at time of discharge,\nVanc was changed to Linezolid to complete the course at home.\nCough was treated symptomatically.  Pt was discharged with O2\nsuppl.\n.\n#. Pericardial Effusion: Patient was tachycardic on\npresentation. There was concern that it may be related to the\npatient's hypoxia or another underlying process such as a PE or\npossibly hypovolemia. Antibiotics for her pneumonia as above.\nIntravenous fluids were given for hypovolemia with little change\nin heart rate. A CT was ordered as above to evaluate further,\nwhich was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did reveal a\nmoderate-to-large pericardial effusion. A TTE was ordered to\nevaluate further and revealed evidence of tamponade physiology.\nMoreover, the patient had a pulsus paradoxus of 16-18 mm Hg on\nexam. The interventional cardiology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] who\nperformed pericardiocentesis which produced 470mL serosanguanous\nfluid which was consistent with exudate by lites criteria. Over\nthe next day, the drain put out another 500cc of fluid. The\nfluid was sent for cultures which were all negative.  Cytology\non pericarial fluid was positive for malignant cells. After one\nday, the pericardial drain was pulled, and the tip sent for\nculture which was also negative, and the patient was transfered\nout of the CCU. After arrival to [**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained stable on NC,\nhowever clinically appeared still distressed.  On [**2180-11-3**], a\nrepeat ECHO was performed and it showed small pericardical\neffusion, reassuring us that the fluid had not reaccumulated.\nPer Cardiology recs, pt was instrusted to get another repeat\nECHO on [**2180-11-22**] when she return for her outpt appt with\noncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] will follow-up on the ECHO\nresults.\n.\n# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a mild\nmetabolic acidosis and an anion gap of 15. The most immediate\nconcern was for a lactic acidosis from her respiratory distress\nand impaired tissue oxygenation or a possible starvation\nketosis. Repeat labs the morning after admission revealed a\nworsening of her acidosis with a HCO3 of 15 (down from 20 on\nadmission). An ABG revealed an appropriate respiratory\ncompensation with a pCO2 of 31. The metabolic acidosis soon\nresolved and pt remained stable.\n.\n# Breast cancer: CT on admission showed dramatic progression of\nmetastatic disease involving the lungs bilaterally. She was\ncontinued on capecitabine 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **], and transfered to the\noncology service. Once on [**Hospital1 2035**], given pt's breast cancer was\nprogressing on current therapy (CA27-29 rising) and pt's\nclinical status was deteriorating, inpt attending and outpt\noncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] discussed started a new chemotherapy\nregimen.  Thus, pt's capecitabine was stopped and on [**2180-11-3**] pt\nwas given Herceptin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin.  20 minutes into\nthe infusion, Herceptin was stopped bc pt developed SOB and\nhypoxia to mid 80s.  Pt's symptoms resolved with time, Ativan\nand Lasix.  Herceptin was attempted again on [**2180-11-6**].  This\ntime the infusion was stopped 60 min into the infusion bc pt\ndeveloped tachycardia. Pt's symptoms resolved with time.  Pt was\nstarted on Neupogen 24 hours after chemotherapy administration\nto prevent neutropenia.  The Neupogen was discontinued on day of\ndischarge as pt's WBC was still >15.\n.\n# Elevated LFTs: Pt had midly elevated LFTs after chemo\nadministration, which were trending down with time.\n.\n# Diarrhea:  Pt developed diarrhea during the hospitalization.\nC diff was negative.  Likely [**12-28**] chemo.  Diarrhea improved with\nImodium.\n.\n# Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was approximately 39, at the\npatient's known baseline. The patient subsequently received\nseveral liters of intravenous fluids for her tachycardia and her\nhematocrit came down to 35. Pt's Hct remained stable in the\n31-35 range.  Pt did not require any transfusions.\n.\n# Crohn's: Patient was continued on her Mesalamine without\nevent.\n.\n# Pt was on regular diet.  Pt was full code.  Pt was on SC\nHeparin for DVT ppx.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n- Percocet 5/325 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.\n- Mesalamine 1 g p.o. daily\n- Multivitamin one tablet p.o. daily\n- Advil p.r.n.\n- Tylenol p.r.n.\n- Capecetabine 1000 mg PO BID C3D4\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
