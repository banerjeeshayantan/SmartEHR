He underwent a CT\nscan of the chest, which also showed a lung nodule.  On [**2-14**]\ncardiac catheterization showed a left main 90% stenosed LAD,\n90% stenosed circumflex, 80% stenosis proximal RCA occlusion.\nThe ejection fraction then was 35% on cardiac\ncatheterization.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Diabetes mellitus.\n2.  Hypertension.\n3.  Prostatic cancer.\n4.  Lung nodule.\n5.  Hyponatremia.\n6.  Coronary artery disease.\n7.

Chem 7 was 132, 4.5,\n97.7, 18, 1.0, and 108.  Coagulations were 12, 1.1, and 30.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU on the\n29th.  The patient was preoperatively prepared on the 30th.\nThe patient went on the 31st for a coronary artery bypass\ngraft times two, off pump, with proximal device for LIMA to\nLAD and diversion bypass.  Please see the operative note for\nfull details.  He was transferred to the unit postoperatively\non drips.  He did well on postoperative day #1 and he was\ntransferred to the floor.\n\nPostoperatively, he had an episode of hypotension on\npostoperative day #1.  After he arrived on the floor, this\nwas resolved after being given some blood and fluids.\n\nOn postoperative day #2, he was doing well with no\ncomplications.  He started rehabilitation and discharge\nplanning.\n\nOn postoperative day #3, the patient continued to do well.\nIt was noted that the sodium was low during this stay on the\nfloor, he was fluid restricted and started on sodium\nsupplements.  The Department of Medicine was called to\nevaluate his low sodium.  It was felt that it was a nonacute\nevent and chronically ongoing with him and it should be\nworked up on an outpatient basis once the Lasix was off.  The\nprimary care physician will be able to follow that up.  It\nwas noted that his left groin incision from the cardiac\ncatheterization was poorly approximated and likely open.  We\nstarted packing with wet-to-dry dressing normal saline\ndressings.  Meanwhile, while the patient was working with the\nDepartment of Rehabilitation and was a level IV to V on\n[**2124-2-24**].
