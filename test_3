Unchanged appearance of residual sacrum with\nadjacent posterior\nfocal radiotracer uptake, again apparently within adjacent soft\ntissues.\nHowever, given the proximity of the uptake, bony involvement\nwith infection\ncannot be excluded.\n2. Similar sclerotic appearance of right lower ischium and\nadjacent soft\ntissue thickening. Although the CT appearance suggests chronic\nosteomyelitis,\nimmediately adjacent radiotracer activity has resolved and the\nbony abnormality\nappears unchanged.\n3. New cellulitis along the right lower buttock, at the\ninterface with the\nthigh and inferior to the prior site of infection.\n4. More extensive radiotracer uptake in the left lower buttock,\nwith fat\nstranding on CT suggesting cellulitis. Although the soft tissue\nabnormality\nextends to the ischial tuberosity, there is no CT evidence of\nbone destruction\nor abnormal bony radiotracer uptake in this area.\n\n[**2106-4-6**] 6:38 pm SWAB      Source: left ischial tuberosity.\n\n                            **FINAL REPORT [**2106-4-10**]**\n\n   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2106-4-6**]):\n      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR\nLEUKOCYTES.\n      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.\n\n   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2106-4-10**]):\n      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an\nabbreviated\n      workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered\nfrom the\n      site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa,\nStaphylococcus\n      aureus and beta streptococcus).\n      Susceptibility will be performed on P. aeruginosa and S.\naureus if\n      sparse growth or greater.\n      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
